## Features of application

- Login with username and password
- Displaying all messages sended or received by logged in person
- Searching in messages (done on backend by api, see below API section)
- Sending a message to specific person/people or for all
- Refreshing messages (getting new one, just calling api point /messages)
- Logout
- Except salt in hash I also added a bit of salt to css ðŸ™‚ (at least to the message bubbles)

Originally I had API and DB info here, but eventually I add a [separate part](https://www.notion.so/INF226-Assignment-2-3-5e75064a53f44401b9c53c253397eb06).

## How to test/demo it

At first you need to clone this git.

After that install all required packages (`requirements.txt`)(probably a few of them are already pre-installed with python):

`pip install flask flask_wtf flask_login apsw markupspace pygments bcrypt werkzeug wtforms`

or run

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

Last command is to run flask:

`flask run` 

Note from login-server git: If the `flask` command doesn't exist, you can start use `python -m flask run` instead.

In database are created 2 users. Password are in bcrypt format, so if you want to change them, generate hash at [https://bcrypt-generator.com/](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)

Database is stored in `tiny.sqlite` file, so for adding users just open it in some SQLite editor and add them.

| username | password |
| --- | --- |
| alice | 123 |
| bob | 123 |

## Technical details of implementation

- **GET** /messages
    
    **Arguments**

- **GET** /messages/<ID>

A SQLite Database is used.
